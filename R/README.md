# R Visualization 

This directory contains a jupyter notebook demonstrating how to develop visualizations with ggplot2 as well as series of R code to demonstrate "Shiny", an R package designed to build interactive web applications. The Shiny code will need to be run with an R environment such as the RGui installed as part of the normal R distribution or [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), an interactive development environment, that is available in an open source edition.
